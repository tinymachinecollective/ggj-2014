Cat Attack (Global Game Entry 2014)
===================================

You are a panther in the jungle... or are you? Hunt down your prey while avoiding the giant death monster! Official Global Game Jam page: http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/cat-attack

### Editor Keybindings
* F2: _Enter the editor_
* L: _Load the existing level.xml file_
* S: _Overwrite the level.xml file (it becomes useful to back this file up if you can find it!)
* Click: _places a tile_
* Home/End: _cycle through the layers_
* Page Up/Page Down: _cycle through the tiles available_
* Tab: _change the tileset for the current layer_
* Space: _add a new layer_
* W: Enter walk placement mode (behaves like any other layer)

### Diversifiers
* You Only Live Thrice: _The player only has 3 lives and each level starts over when you die._
* I am who I want to be: _The game has characters, but nothing in their design suggests a gender._
* Honor Aaron Swartz: _The game only uses materials found in the public domain._

### Technology Notes
Custom built in XNA, hybrid of 2D and 3D. The team had one sound guy and two programmers so all our visual art was sourced from the public domain, although we did steal Nicholas McDonnell from another team to animate a pre-rigged model. Press F2 at any time for the level editor.
