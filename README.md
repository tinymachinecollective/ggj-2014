Cat Attack (Global Game Entry 2014)
===================================

You are a panther in the jungle... or are you? Hunt down your prey while avoiding the giant death monster! Official Global Game Jam page: http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/cat-attack

### Diversifiers
* You Only Live Thrice: _The player only has 3 lives and each level starts over when you die._
* I am who I want to be: _The game has characters, but nothing in their design suggests a gender._
* Honor Aaron Swartz: _The game only uses materials found in the public domain._

### Technology Notes
Custom built in XNA, hybrid of 2D and 3D. The team had one sound guy and two programmers so all our visual art was sourced from the public domain, although we did steal Nicholas McDonnell from another team to animate a pre-rigged model. Press F2 at any time for the level editor.
